i started the project at the HTML file i've downloaded from udacity 
and started by adding a section 
then i reviewed the code that've been written in CSS file and i thought that i could add a smooth scroll down to the page
for the user to feel warm 
at JS i've wrote the code that should've worked for the landing page you asked for but, unfortunatelty the nav bar didn't appear and i was running out of time so i had to submit it like that 
i don't really know wwhat's wrong about it 
and i hope you appreciate my hard working throught the course 
and i hope that i m not getting revoked because of such a mistake like that
